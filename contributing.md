# Contributing to SIH-183

Welcome to the team! Before pushing any code, review these standards.

## 1. Branching & Commit Workflow
* `main`: Only stable, working demo code. Protected branch.
* `dev`: Integration branch. Pull requests are merged here first.
* Feature branches: Follow the naming rule:
  * `feat/ingestion-trongrid`
  * `feat/graph-cytoscape`
  * `fix/bfs-loop-detection`

## Branch Naming

Create a separate branch for each issue or change.

```text
feature/<description>
fix/<description>
docs/<description>
refactor/<description>
test/<description>
chore/<description>
```

Example:

```text
docs/add-contributing-guide
```

Do not commit directly to `main`.

### Commit Message Standard
Use conventional commits:
* `feat: add TRC20 transfer parsing`
* `fix: prevent infinite loop on DEX router contracts`
* `docs: update API documentation`

## Commit Messages

Use the following format:

```text
<type>: <description>
```

Common types:

```text
feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, chore
```

Examples:

```text
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login validation
docs: add contributing guide
```

Keep commits small and focused.

## 2. Local Setup Protocol
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd SIH-183 

2. git basic commands

    reate a new repository on the command line
echo "# SIH-183" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M <branch>
git remote add origin https://github.com/vicky4t/SIH-183.git
git push -u origin <branch>

push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/vicky4t/SIH-183.git
git branch -M <branch>
git push -u origin HEAD(your current branch)
